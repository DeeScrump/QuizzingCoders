# QuizzingCoders
Second Attempt at creating a site for quizzing coders with timer

## Expectations
1. User will land on a page where they find nav items for a linkable HighScores page and a Timer.  In the middle they will find a statement about a quiz and a start button

2. User will find that pressing start immediately brings up the first question and the timer begins, whose set time is 15 seconds per question.

3. User will find that upon making an answer choice and clicking, the site advises right or wrong before proceeding to the next question.

4. The user will find that once clicking a wrong answer results in time speeding up 5 seconds.

5. The user will find that either at the end of the quiz or when time runs out, they are directed to a view of their timed score and text box to place their initials.

6. User should find that once initials are submitted, they will be directed to the highscore page where they can view their initials in order of highest score. They will find buttons to go back or clear the high scores.
